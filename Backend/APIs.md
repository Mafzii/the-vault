***Application Programming Interface***
	specifies how 2 software components communicate
### REST
- REST defines a set of functions GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to carry out operations on server data
- APIs that are REST compliant are called RESTful APIs
- Clients and servers communicate through HTTP
	- Implementation of both are done separately, so the client or server side code can be changed without affecting the operation of the other
- REST APIs are stateless
	- Servers do not save client data between requests
	- This means each request is processed independently of previous requests
- Client requests have the following:
	- An HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
	- A path to access resources (URI)
		- convention for path is the plural form of the resource
		- e.g. for a user, getting a list of all users will be /users
	- Header to provide supplementary information
		- e.g. Accept: application/json
	- Message body with payload (optional)
- REST Principles
	- Client-server architecture. The sender and receiver are independent of each other regarding technology, platforming, programming language, and so on.
	- Layered. The server can have several intermediaries that work together to complete client requests, but they are invisible to the client.
	- Uniform interface. The API returns data in a standard format that is complete and fully useable.
	- Stateless. The API completes every new request independently of previous requests.
	- Cacheable. All API responses are cacheable.
	- Code on demand. The API response can include a code snippet if required.
### Common response codes

### JSON API

- Automatic caching, in REST you would have to implement caching strategies yourself
- Built in error msg field with standard messages
- Can request partial responses if only a certain field is needed

### SOAP
- Uses XML only to communicate via HTTP
- Better suited for security out of the box, in REST other modules would be needed to make it secure
- Generally used to extend legacy systems already built with SOAP APIs
- ACID compliance is built in out of the box

### gRPC
- Remote Procedure Call framework
- RPC is a protocol that allows a program to execute a procedure of another program located on another computer. The great advantage is that the developer doesnâ€™t need to code the details of the remote interaction. The remote procedure is called like any other function. But the client and the server can be coded in different languages.
